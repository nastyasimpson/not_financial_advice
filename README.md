# Not Financial Advice  
**Unveiling Trust in the Chaos of Crypto Predictions**  
*Your Data-Driven Compass for Bitcoin Influencer Credibility*  

Welcome to **Not Financial Advice**, a DataExpert Capstone by Anastasia Simpson designed to bring clarity to the noisy world of cryptocurrency predictions. This project helps users navigate Bitcoin influencer claims with a dynamic **Trust Score**‚Äîa metric that highlights who‚Äôs worth listening to amid the flood of "not financial advice" chatter.

## üåü The Vision  
In today‚Äôs crypto landscape, X influencers shape Bitcoin sentiment, often with little transparency around their credibility. Our goal? To offer **clear, actionable insight** by scoring influencers on their prediction accuracy and consistency. Whether you‚Äôre new to trading or a seasoned investor, this tool helps you figure out: *Who‚Äôs signal, and who‚Äôs just noise?*

## üöÄ What We Do  
- **Capture the Market**: Pulls live and historical Bitcoin data from Polygon API (since Feb 24, 2025).  
- **Decode the Influencers**: Analyzes X posts from top Bitcoin voices (e.g., TheMoonCarl, WhalePanda) using advanced LLMs.  
- **Score the Trust**: Builds a **Trust Score** based on prediction accuracy and sentiment reliability.  
- **Visualize the Truth**: Powers an interactive Streamlit app, live on Streamlit Cloud, with clear, actionable insights.  

**Key Callout**: *Our Trust Score isn‚Äôt just data‚Äîit‚Äôs your edge in a volatile market.*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack: The Powerhouse Behind the Project  
We‚Äôve built **Not Financial Advice** on a reliable, scalable stack designed for precision and growth. Here‚Äôs how each piece fits:  

| **Component**            | **Tool**             | **Why We Chose It**                                                                 |  
|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Data Sources**         | **Polygon API**      | Delivers real-time, reliable BTC price data (OHLCV) with top-tier accuracy.        |  
|                          | **X API + Tweepy**   | Streams influencer posts efficiently, capturing sentiment from the crypto pulse.  |  
| **Sentiment Analysis**   | **LangChain + OpenAI**| Powers LLM-driven scoring (1‚Äì10) for Buy/Sell intent with sharp precision.       |  
| **Storage & Processing** | **AWS S3 + Boto3**   | Secure, scalable storage for raw and processed data, with tight AWS integration.  |  
|                          | **Snowflake**        | Cloud-native warehouse with Snowpipe for real-time ingestion and Tasks for automation.|  
| **Transformation**       | **dbt**              | Modular SQL transforms raw data into analytics-ready tables, with built-in tests. |  
| **Orchestration**        | **Airflow + Astronomer** | Automates daily pipelines locally (Docker) and scales to the cloud with Astronomer.|  
| **Visualization**        | **Streamlit**        | Builds a clean, interactive dashboard‚Äîeasy to deploy, intuitive to use.          |  

### Deep Dive: Why This Stack Works  
- **Polygon API**: High-frequency BTC data keeps our price trends fresh and accurate.  
- **Tweepy + X API**: Optimized for 15,000 posts/month, targeting key influencers (e.g., 50 posts/day across 5 voices).  
- **LangChain + OpenAI**: Scores sentiment with a custom prompt, adept at nuances like ‚ÄúDO NOT SELL.‚Äù  
- **AWS S3 + Boto3**: Stores CSV files (e.g., `btc_prices_<date>.csv`) securely, triggering Snowflake ingestion via notifications.  
- **Snowflake**: Snowpipe auto-loads data into staging tables, with Tasks splitting it into `trust_score.raw.analyzed_tweets` and `trust_score.raw.btc_prices`.  
- **dbt**: Models like `btc_analytics.sql` and `trust_score_analytics.sql` ensure clean, validated outputs in `TRUST_SCORE.ANALYTICS`.  
- **Airflow + Astronomer**: Runs `combined_dag.py` locally in Docker, with plans for cloud orchestration on Astronomer.  
- **Streamlit**: Deploys a sleek UI with minimal fuss, hosted live for instant access.  

**Bold Claim**: *This stack balances simplicity and power‚Äîbuilt to deliver today, ready to scale tomorrow.*
